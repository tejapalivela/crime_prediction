        <li>The adjusted threshold value for the predictions' accuracy is 65%, as the study of algorithms suggests that not all the standard algorithms are suitable for these predictions when considered directly.</li>
        <li>The accuracy of the predictions of certain states for a particular crime type show drastic values which are improved by identifying the trend changing year. This compensates for the issue of insufficient or unsuitable data being used for predictions.</li>
        <li>The data of newly established states has also been considered which may not have sufficient data for predictions. This is handled using data wrangling.</li>
        <li>This system would achieve more accuracy and functionalities as the data supplied to the system would increase.</li>
        <li>Certain cases of prediction may not seem to be ideal due to the availability of data which depends on the timely and systematic reporting of data. The lack of ideal reported data indicates that there could be: 
            <li style="margin-left: 40px;">Lack of awareness among the victims</li>
            <li style="margin-left: 40px;">Fear of the loss of reputation of the victims in the society</li>
            <li style="margin-left: 40px;">Disorganized reporting of cases</li>
        </li>
        <h2 style = "font-family:verdana; padding-left: 0%; text-align:left">Analysis:</h2>
<ul>
    <li> It calculates the change in crime rate by year and categorizes it as low, moderate, or high based on certain thresholds. It can be used for various purposes</li>
  <li>Law Enforcement: Police departments can use this code to analyze crime rates over several years and detect patterns and trends. The results can be used to allocate resources more effectively and efficiently, by focusing on areas with high crime rates.</li>
  <li>Journalism: Journalists can use this code to analyze and present crime data to the public. The analysis can be used to highlight issues related to crime rates in the state, and the message displayed can be used to raise awareness among the public.</li>
  <li>Academia: Academics can use this code to teach data analysis concepts to students. The code provides a simple and practical example of how to analyze and present data using JavaScript and HTML.</li>
  <li>Government: Government officials can use this code to monitor crime rates over time and take appropriate actions. For example, if the number of years with a high crime rate is increasing, officials can take steps to address the underlying causes of the increase.</li>
</ul>
<p>Overall, the code can be used by anyone who needs to analyze and present crime data in a simple and intuitive way. It provides a practical example of how to use JavaScript and HTML to create a dynamic and interactive data visualization.</p>
